# README: Deep Learning for Time Series Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This project explores the application of Deep Learning models like RNN, LSTM, and GRU for analyzing and forecasting time-series data. It compares these models with traditional approaches (ARIMA, SARIMA) in predicting stock prices.

## 2. Project Details

### Objectives
- Forecast stock prices for companies in banking, retail, and technology sectors.
- Compare Deep Learning models with traditional methods using metrics like MSE and RMSE.

---

## 3. Methods
1. **Traditional Models**:
   - ARIMA and SARIMA for trend and seasonality.

2. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - RNN: For sequential patterns.
   - LSTM: Addressing long-term dependencies.
   - GRU: Simplified LSTM for efficiency.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE.

## 4. Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and transforming datasets.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train ARIMA and Deep Learning models on historical stock data.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Analyze accuracy using test datasets.

---

## 5. Tools
- **Programming**: Python (TensorFlow, Keras, pandas).
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.

---

## 6. Key Results
- LSTM demonstrated superior accuracy in long-term forecasts.
- ARIMA excelled in short-term predictions but struggled with non-linear data.
